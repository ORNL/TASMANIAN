# searches for libmagma.{a,so,dylib} and libmagma_sparse.{a,so,dylib}
# and the associated include folder

# using (optional) variables:
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR
#     MAGMA_ROOT_DIR
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_LIBRARIES
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_INCLUDE_DIRS
#
# defines variables:
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_FOUND: ON/OFF
#         indicates success/fail
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_FOUND: ON/OFF
#         ON if libraries with not ".a" suffix are found
#
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES: list
#         list of libraries to use for static linking
#         (the libraries could be shared libraries w/o warning)
#
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_LIBRARIES: list
#         list of libraries to use for shared linking
#         (if the libraries appear static with ".a" extension
#          then Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_FOUND will be OFF)
#
#     Tasmanian_MAGMA_INCLUDE_DIRS: path
#         path to MAGMA headers
#
# recommended use:
#     set(Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR "<path-to-magma>")
#     find_package(TasmanianMagma)
#
# alternatively, use -D Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR=<path-to-magma>
#
#
# detailed use:
#
# MODE 1: User provides a list of libraries Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES
#    (required by sXDK cmake policies)
#
#    the module will check if files exist for all libraries given in
#    Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES and Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_LIBRARIES
#    if successful, Tasmanian_MAGMA_FOUND is set ON
#    otherwise, Tasmanian_MAGMA_FOUND is set OFF
#
#    Note: this MODE will not create variable Tasmanian_MAGMA_INCLUDE_DIRS
#          in this MODE the user must specify this manually
#
#    if Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_LIBRARIES is not provided
#        the value in Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES is used instead
#
#    if no library in Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_LIBRARIES has ".a" extension
#        Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_FOUND is also set ON
#
# MODE 2: User provides a path Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR
#         (assuming Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES is not set)
#
#    use find_library() and look for
#        libmagma.{so,dylib,a}
#        libmagma_sparse.{so,dylib,a}
#    using Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR as HINTS
#
#    if Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR is given
#        standard cmake search paths will be omitted from find_library()
#        (xSDK policy: do not silently replace a package if the user has
#         explicitly specified a version)
#
#    if all magma or _sparse libraries are missing
#        set Tasmanian_MAGMA_FOUND to OFF
#
#    if all variants of either magma or magma_sparse end on ".a" suffix,
#        then Tasmanian_MAGMA_SHARED_FOUND is set OFF
#
#    if only shared libraries are found
#        shared libraries will be used in Tasmanian_MAGMA_LIBRARIES
#
#    use find_path() to search for magma.h using HINTS
#        ${Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR}/include
#        ${Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR}
#        <path>/../../include
#        <path>/../include
#        <path>/include
#    where <path> is the folder containing libmagma.so (or .a), usually
#    <magma root>/lib/ or <magma root>/lib/<arch>/, thus we search two
#    levels up from <path>=<magma root>/lib/<arch>/
#    standard cmake search paths are also considered, since if libmagma
#    was found in the Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR, then the headers will be
#    found there first
#
# NOTE: if Tasmanian_MAGMA_ROOT_DIR is missing,
#           find_library() will be called using standard search,
#           if CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is set correctly, this will find MAGMA
#
# NOTE: the complexity of the logic is needed to ensure
#       - both static and shared libraries are found (if available)
#       - the user can explicitly specify libraries (if desired)
#       - compliance with xSDK policies (if using xSDK defaults)
# https://figshare.com/articles/xSDK_Community_Installation_Policies_GNU_Autoconf_and_CMake_Options/4495133
#
#    Additional confusion can be created by projects that compile static
#    libraries with position independent code, effectively creating
#    shared libraries with .a extension. Thus, the check for the shared
#    library extension cannot be considered as FATAL_ERROR
