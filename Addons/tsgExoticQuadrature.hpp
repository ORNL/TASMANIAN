 *
 * \par Exotic Quadrature
 * The Exotic Quadrature module of Tasmanian offers a collection of functions for generating one dimensional quadrature rules
 * with weight function that are not strictly non-negative. The quadrature rules are loaded inside TasGrid::CustomTabulated
 * objects and be used in calls to TasmanianSparseGrid::makeGlobalGrid() to extend those to a multidimensional context.
 *
 * \par
 * The integral of interest has the form \f$ \int_{-1}^{1} f(x) \rho(x) dx \f$ and it differs from the classical Gaussian
 * rules by allowing the weight function \f$ \rho(x) \f$ to be negative in portions of the domain.
 * We still require that the weight is integrable and bounded from below, i.e., \f$ \int_{-1}^{1} | \rho(x) | dx < \infty \f$
 * and \f$ \rho(x) \geq c > -\infty \f$.
 *
 * \par
 * The quadrature consists of two components, one is a quadrature that uses classical Gaussian construction using
 * the root of polynomials that are orthogonal with respect to a shifted positive weight \f$ \rho(x) + c \geq 0 \f$
 * and a correction term using Gauss-Legendre rule scaled by -c.
 * While the asymptotic convergence rate is inferior to that of Gauss-Legendre, for small number of points
 * the accuracy of the combined quadrature rule can be significantly greater.
 * This advantage if further magnified in a sparse grid context where reaching the asymptotic regime for Gauss-Legendre
 * may require a prohibitive number of points due to the curse of dimensionality.
 *
 * \par
 * The weight can be defined either with a C++ lambda expression or a one-dimensional TasmanianSparseGrid object.
 * The lambda expression will be evaluated at a large number of Gauss-Legendre points that will be used for
 * a reference quadrature to build the orthogonal polynomial basis.
 * In the case of a sparse grid object, only the loaded points and quadrature weights will be used
 * and no interpolation will be performed inbetween (i.e., we circumvent potential interpolation error).
