/*!
 * \ingroup TasmanianSGClass
 * \brief The master-class that represents an instance of a Tasmanian sparse grid.
 *
 * \par class TasmanianSparseGrid
 * An object of this class represents a sparse grid, all aspects of the grid
 * can be accessed through member methods.
 * Each object operates independently to the extend allowed by third-party
 * libraries, e.g., making concurrent calls to OpenBLAS will result in a race
 * condition unless OpenBLAS is compiled with a special flag.
 * The available member methods are split into groups that deal with
 * different aspects of the grid.
 * The object itself wraps around one of five different types of grids,
 * Global, Sequence, Local Polynomial, Wavelet, and Fourier,
 * each using different back-end data structures.
 * The class itself handles the domain transformations,
 * e.g., the translation between the canonical [-1, 1] and a user provided [a, b],
 * as well as mechanisms to select acceleration back-end, common meta I/O,
 * and error checking.
 *
 * \par Error Handling
 * \b TasmanianSparseGrid throws \b std::invalid_argument and \b std::runtime_error
 * exceptions with simple human-readable messages.
 * The \b std::invalid_argument exception indicates method call arguments of
 * insufficient or incompatible data, e.g., vectors have insufficient size
 * or negative number was given in place of a positive one.
 * The \b std::runtime_error indicates problems with missing files, incorrect
 * file format, or out-of-order function calls, e.g., adaptive refinement
 * strategies require model values in order to infer the optimal structure of
 * the grid, therefore calling a refinement method before model values are
 * provided will result in a \b std::runtime_error.
 * Similarly, \b std::runtime_error will be thrown if a method is called
 * with the wrong grid type, e.g., global anisotropic coefficients cannot be
 * computed for local polynomial grids.
 *
 * If CUDA acceleration is used, CUDA error may be encountered, e.g.,
 * incorrect driver initialization, out-of-memory, etc.
 * Tasmanian will translate CUDA error codes and messages into
 * \b std::runtime_error exceptions and such exceptions can be raised
 * by any method that uses acceleration.
 *
 * \par Constructors and Copy/Move assignment
 * TasGrid::TasmanianSparseGrid includes move and copy constructors
 * and assignment operator= overloads.
 * There is also a default constructor that creates an empty grid.
 * Note that move will preserve the enabled acceleration mode and the internal
 * cache data-structures, while copy will reset the acceleration to the default.
 * - TasmanianSparseGrid()
 * - copyGrid()
 *
 * \par Make Grid Methods
 * Each of the five grid types comes with a separate make command.
 * The first three parameters are always the number of inputs (dimensions),
 * the number of outputs, and the initial depth or level of the grid.
 * The remaining parameters are specific to the type of grid.
 * - makeGlobalGrid()
 * - makeSequenceGrid()
 * - makeLocalPolynomialGrid()
 * - makeWaveletGrid()
 * - makeFourierGrid()
 * - see also the factory methods, e.g., TasGrid::makeGlobalGrid()
 *
 * \par Domain Transformations
 * In most cases, sparse grids are constructed on a canonical domain [-1, 1].
 * The exceptions are the Fourier grids with domain [0, 1], and the
 * Gauss-Hermite and Gauss-Laguerre rules with unbounded domain, see
 * TasGrid::rule_gausshermite and TasGrid::rule_gausslaguerre for details.
 * Tasmanian can automatically apply a linear domain transformations shifting
 * the canonical interval to an arbitrary [a, b] or a non-linear (conformal)
 * transformation that may accelerate convergence for some models.
 * Each dimension of the grid can have a different linear and/or non-linear
 * transform.
 * - setDomainTransform(), getDomainTransform()
 * - isSetDomainTransfrom(), clearDomainTransform()
 * - setConformalTransformASIN(), getConformalTransformASIN()
 * - isSetConformalTransformASIN(), clearConformalTransform()
 *
 * \par Stream and File I/O
 * Sparse grid objects can be written to and from files and \b std::ostream objects.
 * Tasmanian supports both binary and ASCII formats; the binary format
 * has lower overhead in both file size and operations required to read/write,
 * the ASCII format is portable without considerations of endians and
 * for small grids the files are human-readable which helps debugging.
 * - read(), TasGrid::readGrid()
 * - write()
 *
 * \par Get Points and Weights
 * The points on the grid are labeled as "loaded" or "needed" based on
 * whether the associated model values are already provided by the user.
 * The grid points are also associated with quadrature and interpolation
 * weights, where the computed weights correspond to the loaded points
 * unless all points are labeled as needed. If the grid is set to work
 * with zero model outputs, then the distinction is meaningless and
 * the points will be accessed through the generic getPoints() methods.
 * - getNumLoaded(), getNumNeeded(), getNumPoints()
 * - getLoadedPoints(), getNeededPoints(), getPoints()
 * - getLoadedValues()
 * - getQuadratureWeights()
 * - getInterpolationWeights()
 *
 * \par Load Model Values or Hierarchical Coefficients
 * In order to construct an interpolant, Tasmanian needed to compute the
 * coefficients of the basis functions. The user can directly provide the
 * coefficients, e.g., computed externally with a regression method using
 * an unstructured set of samples, or the user can provide the model values
 * at the needed points and let Tasmanian do the computations.
 * - TasGrid::loadNeededPoints()
 * - loadNeededPoints(), getLoadedValues()
 * - setHierarchicalCoefficients()
 *
 * \par Update and Adaptive Refinement
 * The most efficient approximation schemes adapt the grid (and the associated
 * basis functions) to the target model. Tasmanian provides several adaptive
 * procedures tailored to different types of grids.
 * The refinement requires two-way communication between the model and
 * Tasmanian, i.e., Tasmanian provides an initial set of points, the model
 * provides the values, then Tasmanian provides an updated set of points, and so on.
 * This can be done either in batches of point or in dynamic construction setup
 * where values can be given one at a time in an arbitrary order (see next paragraph).
 * See also the papers referenced in TasGrid::TypeDepth and TasGrid::TypeRefinement.
 * - updateGlobalGrid(), updateSequenceGrid(), updateFourierGrid()
 * - setAnisotropicRefinement(), setSurplusRefinement()
 * - clearRefinement()
 * - getLevelLimits(), clearLevelLimits()
 * - removePointsByHierarchicalCoefficient()
 *
 * \par Dynamic Construction
 * The standard refinement procedure works in batches, where all model values
 * for the batch have to be computed externally and loaded together in the
 * correct order. The dynamic construction alleviates those restrictions,
 * but comes at an increase cost since Tasmanian has to do more work and
 * store extra data. The dynamic construction (and the internal data-structures)
 * are initiated with the beginConstruction() command and batch refinement
 * cannot be used until the procedure is concluded. See also TasGrid::constructSurrogate()
 * that can take a user defined model and fully automate the construction process.
 * - TasGrid::constructSurrogate()
 * - beginConstruction(), finishConstruction()
 * - getCandidateConstructionPoints()
 * - loadConstructedPoints()
 *
 * \par Using Unstructured Data
 * The standard sparse grid methods assume that model data is available at the very
 * specific grid points that are chosen according to optimal estimates.
 * However, in some cases, the model inputs cannot be controlled precisely
 * and only randomly samples model data is available.
 * Sparse grids can still produce accurate surrogates using such unstructured
 * data by effectively removing the points and working only with the underlying
 * basis (the basis is still optimal for the corresponding class of functions).
 * The hierarchical basis method allow direct access to the values of
 * the basis functions and the associated coefficients.
 * - evaluateHierarchicalFunctions(), evaluateSparseHierarchicalFunctions()
 * - evaluateHierarchicalFunctionsGPU(), evaluateSparseHierarchicalFunctionsGPU()
 * - setHierarchicalCoefficients(), getHierarchicalCoefficients()
 * - integrateHierarchicalFunctions()
 * - getHierarchicalSupport()
 *
 * \par Evaluate Methods
 * The evaluate methods compute the sparse grid approximation to the model for
 * arbitrary point within the domain, i.e., for points that don't necessarily
 * align with the original grid.
 * The batch and fast evaluate method can leverage accelerated linear algebra
 * libraries such as BLAS, cuBLAS and MAGAMA.
 * See the documentation for TasGrid::TypeAcceleration for details.
 * - evaluate()
 * - evaluateBatch(), evaluateBatchGPU(), evaluateFast()
 * - integrate()
 *
 * \par Acceleration Back-end Selection
 * Allows specifying the acceleration used for evaluation methods and (in some
 * cases) for computing the basis coefficients during loadNeededPoints().
 * For example, methods are provided to check the number of available CUDA
 * devices and to select an active device on a multi-GPU system.
 * - enableAcceleration(), getAccelerationType(), favorSparseAcceleration()
 * - setGPUID(), getGPUID(), getNumGPUs()
 * - isAccelerationAvailable(), getGPUName(), getGPUMemory()
 *
 * \par Get Grid Meta-data
 * Various method that read the number of points, grid type, specifics about
 * the rule and domain transformations and others.
 * Some of the output is in human-readable format for debugging and sanity check.
 * - getNumDimensions(), getNumOutputs(), getRule()
 * - getCustomRuleDescription()
 * - getAlpha(), getBeta(), getOrder()
 * - isGlobal(), isSequence(), isLocalPolynomial(), isFourier(), isWavelet()
 * - isEmpty(), empty()
 * - printStats()
 *
 * \par Get Library Meta-data
 * Runtime API is provided for the library version and various compile
 * time options.
 * Those methods are \b static and are included in the class API solely for
 * consistency reasons.
 * - getVersion(), getVersionMajor(), getVersionMinor(), getLicense()
 * - getGitCommitHash(), getCmakeCxxFlags(), isOpenMPEnabled()

     * \brief Make a Global Grid using Lagrange polynomials with support over the entire domain.
     *
     * Construct a sparse grid with the given set of parameters.
     * \param dimensions is a positive integer specifying the dimension or number of model inputs of the grid.
     * There is no hard restriction on how big the dimension can be; however, for large dimensions,
     * the number of points of the sparse grid grows fast and hence the grid may require a prohibitive amount of memory.
     * \param outputs is a non-negative integer specifying the number of outputs for the model.
     * If outputs is zero, then the grid can only generate quadrature and interpolation weights.
     * There is no hard restriction on how many outputs can be handled; however, Tasmanian requires at least
     * outputs times number of points in storage and the computational complexity of evaluate and I/O methods
     * increases linearly with the number of outputs.
     * \param depth is a non-negative integer that controls the density of grid points.
     * This is commonly referred to the "level" of the grid and corresponds to the L parameter
     * in the formulas for TasGrid::TypeDepth. There is no hard restriction on how big depth can be;
     * however, the number of points have a strong influence on performance and memory requirements.
     * \param type indicates the tensor selection strategy, see TasGrid::TypeDepth.
     * \param rule is one of the global rules, see TasGrid::TypeOneDRule.
     * \param anisotropic_weights indicates the relative "importance" of the inputs.
     * If an empty vector is provided, the isotropic selection is used, i.e., assuming all inputs
     * are equally important.
     * If non-empty vector is given, then the size must match the number of required weights
     * based on the selection \b type, i.e., the \b curved types use 2 x \b dimensions number of
     * weights while the non-curved types use only \b dimensions.
     * Integer values are used, but only the relative scale affects the selection,
     * e.g., {2, 1}, {4, 2}, {20, 10} and {200, 100} are equivalent.
     * The first \b dimensions entries correspond to the \f$ \xi_1, \xi_2, \cdots, \xi_d \f$ weights
     * and the second set corrections to the \f$ \eta_1, \eta_2, \cdots, \eta_d \f$ weights
     * in the formulas in TasGrid::TypeDepth.
     * \param alpha specifies the \f$ \alpha \f$ parameter for the integration weight \f$ \rho(x) \f$,
     * ignored when \b rule is doesn't have such parameter. See TasGrid::TypeOneDRule.
     * \param beta specifies the \f$ \beta \f$ parameter for the integration weight \f$ \rho(x) \f$,
     * ignored when \b rule is doesn't have such parameter. See TasGrid::TypeOneDRule.
     * \param custom_filename specifies the file containing the custom rule description,
     * used only when \b rule is TasGrid::rule_customtabulated.
     * \param level_limits is either empty or has size \b dimensions indicating the restriction
     * of the levels for each direction which in turn restricts the number of points.
     * For example, limit 1 when using TasGrid::rule_clenshawcurtis will restricts the grid to the
     * mid-point and end-points of the domain. Each dimension can have a different restriction
     * and negative numbers indicate no restriction for that direction.
     *
     * \throws std::invalid_argument with human readable messages when integers are out of range,
     * the \b rule is not a global rule, or the vectors have incorrect size.
     * \throws std::runtime_error if the \b custom_filename if missing, or it cannot be opened,
     * or the format is incorrect.
