 * Many sparse grids methods rely on various linear solvers, sparse iterative, eigenvalue,
 * fast-fourier-transform, and least-squares. Some solvers use third-party-libraries,
 * e.g., BLAS and LAPACK, but others are implemented specifically for Tasmanian.
 * The custom solvers are tuned for the specific problems and can (in the specific circumstances)
 * outperform than general third-party methods.
 * Thus, balance is maintained between external dependencies, performance, and capabilities.
