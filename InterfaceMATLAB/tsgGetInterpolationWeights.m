%
% INPUT:
%
% lGrid: a grid list created by tsgMakeXXX(...) command
%
% mX: an array of size [num_x, dimensions]
%     specifies the points where the interpolant should be evaluated
%     Note: do not confuse points here with the nodes of the grid
%               here points are user specified points to evaluate the
%               interpolant (or approximation)
%
% OUTPUT:
%
% weights: an array of size [num_x, number_of_points]
%          the values associated with the interpolant at those points
%
%  f(mX(i,:)) is approximated by weights(i,:)' * f(points)
%  where points is obtained from the tsgGetPoints() function
